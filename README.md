# QuantPod Log

Welcome to the public development log of **QuantPod**, a portable, low-latency hardware platform for executing quant trading strategies directly on the edge.

QuantPod is designed to process alpha signals and execute trades with minimal latency, no cloud dependency, and full offline capability. This log documents the *non-sensitive* aspects of the build journey — from early sketches and part sourcing to hardware assembly and system validation.

> 🚧 Core architecture, alpha logic, and internal execution engines are being developed privately under `QuantPod`.

## 🔍 Vision

**QuantPod** aims to redefine how quant strategies are deployed by:
- Eliminating cloud latency in trade execution
- Running alphas locally on embedded hardware
- Enabling modular alpha injection and real-time decision processing
- Supporting researchers, traders, and engineers who want edge-native quant infrastructure

## ⚠️ What’s Not Public

To protect IP and maintain strategic advantage, the following are *not* included here:

- Proprietary alpha generation logic
- Source code for the trading engine
- Firmware and microcontroller config
- Execution timing and optimization code
- Backtesting strategies and performance benchmarks

If you’re an investor, collaborator, or legal reviewer please do request access to the private repo.
